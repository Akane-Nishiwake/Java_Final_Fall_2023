This is a final project for a Fall 2023 Advance Java class I took.
To Run the program first run the Server file then the Client file.
Once the Window pops up enter a number for the line to search for, then choose the play you want to search.
Click connect.
Then The client and server will connect and the server will output the 2 lines before, the line you want, and 2 lines after in the window.
